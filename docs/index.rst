.. RocketUnits documentation master file
   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

**RocketUnits** was largely developed on the three companion projects
`RocketCEA <https://rocketcea.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__ ,
`RocketIsp <https://rocketisp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__ and 
`RocketProps <https://rocketprops.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__.

`RocketCEA <https://rocketcea.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__
makes direct calls to the NASA FORTRAN CEA code in “rocket” mode to 
calculate Isp, Cstar, Tcham etc. and provides tools to help determine 
useful mixture ratio range, optimum MR and more.

`RocketIsp <https://rocketisp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__ uses a simplified JANNAF 
approach to calculate delivered specific impulse (Isp) for liquid rocket thrust chambers.

`RocketProps <https://rocketprops.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__
calculates the various liquid propellant properties required to analyse 
a liquid propellant thrust chamber.
